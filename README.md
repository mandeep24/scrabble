# scrabble
Remake of the game of scrabble. There are a few changes to this code I hope to make: 1) I want to continously change the keys the values are associated with in the 'score' dictionary. 2) On windows (my operating system) the time.clock() function returns the wall-clock seconds elapsed since the first call to this function, so to run the programme again you need to save it, then run. 

The 'english_words' is a text file which contains all English words from the English dictionary
